walking through a crowd the village is aglow
kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
everybody here wanted something more
searching for a sound we hadnt heard before
and it said

when we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
took our broken hearts put them in a drawer
everybody here was someone else before
and you can want who you want
boys and boys and girls and girls
